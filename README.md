# Task 11: A/B Testing – Hypothesis Testing in Python

## Objective
To perform A/B testing using a marketing dataset and make a data-driven business decision.

## Dataset
Marketing A/B Testing Dataset (`marketing_AB.csv`)

- Control Group: psa
- Test Group: ad
- Target Metric: Conversion (0/1)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset and identified control and test groups
2. Defined hypotheses (H0, H1) with alpha = 0.05
3. Calculated conversion rates for both groups
4. Selected Chi-Square test for categorical data
5. Computed p-value and tested statistical significance
6. Visualized conversion rates
7. Provided a final business recommendation

## Files in this Repository

- ab_test_summary.csv : Summary of conversion rates
- final_recommendation.txt : Business conclusion
- marketing_AB.csv : Dataset used

## Conclusion
The test group showed a higher conversion rate than the control group, and the result was statistically significant. The ad campaign is recommended for rollout.
