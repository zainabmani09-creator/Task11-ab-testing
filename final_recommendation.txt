An A/B test was conducted to compare conversion rates between users shown ads and users shown PSAs.
The test group (ad) showed a higher conversion rate than the control group (psa).
Since the p-value was below 0.05, the result is statistically significant.
It is recommended to proceed with the ad campaign.
